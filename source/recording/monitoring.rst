Monitoring
==========

When recording, it is important that performers hear themselves, and any pre-recorded tracks they are performing with.

Audio recorders typically allow monitoring (i.e. listening to) the input signal of all tracks that are armed for recording, and playing back the unarmed tracks.

Ardour also includes a :ref:`Foldback section <foldback_strip>` to provide separate monitor mixes for each performer.
