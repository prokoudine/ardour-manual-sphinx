This instrument plugin doesn't work without 3rd party SF2 files,
otherwise it will be silent. `This
thread <https://discourse.ardour.org/t/where-to-find-nice-soundfonts/107686>`__
on the Ardour forum has a number of links to royalty-free samples in the
SF2 file format.

General MIDI Synth
------------------

This is a convenience plugin for playing standard MIDI files. It uses
the FluidSynth engine and the GeneralUser GS soundfont by S. Christian
Collins. The plugin comes with a MIDI map for simple patch selection in
the user interface. General MIDI Synth was developed outside Ardour and
comes bundled with it as 3rd party software in the official builds
available from Ardour's website.

ACE Reasonable Synth
--------------------

This is a very minimal synth with a piano-like sound, developed
primarily for auditioning MIDI files. It comes with no controls, however
it can be used creatively with a number of effects running on top of it.
