Clip properties
===============

The contents of this options box partially depends on the type of data
in the clip, audio or MIDI. The common settings are:

-  **Name**: the full name of the clip's file, usually visible in its
   shortened form.
-  **Load**: this button allows loading a clip's file into the selected
   trigger slot.
-  **Color**: opens up a color chooser dialog to set the color of the
   clip's title inside the trigger slot.

The only audio-specific setting is **Gain (dB)** which adjusts the
output volume of a clip.

For MIDI clips, there are several specific options:

-  **Velocity Adj**: this effectively adjusts the output volume by
   increasing the velocity of MIDI notes.
-  **Send Patches**: this enables sending a control message to load a
   particular patch. This is typically used for external MIDI gear such
   a hardware synthesizers.
-  **MIDI Patches**: clicking this button will open a dialog where a
   patch can be selected to send when a MIDI clip is triggered.
