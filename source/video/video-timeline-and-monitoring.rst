Video timeline and monitoring
=============================

Ardour offers a **video timeline** and **video monitoring** for
convenient audio mixing and editing to video, in order to produce film
soundtracks and music videos, or perform TV post-production tasks.

The video capabilities are:

-  Import a single video and optionally extract the soundtrack from it.
-  Provide a video monitor window, or full-screen display, of the
   imported video in sync with any of the available Ardour timecode
   sources.
-  Display a frame-by-frame (thumbnail) timeline of the video.
-  Allow for a configurable timecode offset.
-  *Lock* audio regions to the video.
-  Move audio regions with the video at video-frame granularity.
-  Export the video, trim start and end, add blank frames and/or
   multiplex it with the soundtrack of the current session.

The setup of the video subsystem is modular and can be configured in
different ways, including:

-  One machine for all video decoding, video monitoring and audio
   editing tasks
-  Two machines, one for video monitoring, one for Ardour
-  Three machines, separate video server (for timeline decoding and file
   archive), dedicated video monitor, and Ardour

Ardour does *not*:

-  allow for more than one video to be loaded at a time.
-  provide video editing capabilities
