Transcoding, formats, and codecs
================================

This chapter provides a short primer on video files, formats and
codecs—because it is often cause for confusion:

A video file is a **container**. It usually contains one **video
track**, one or more **audio tracks**, and possibly **subtitle tracks**,
**chapters**… The way these tracks are stored in the file is defined by
the file format. Common formats are ``avi``, ``mov``, ``ogg``, ``mkv``,
``mpeg``, ``mpeg-ts``, ``mp4``, ``flv``, or ``vob``.

Each of the tracks by itself is encoded using a **codec**. Common video
codecs are ``h264``, ``mpeg2``, ``mpeg4``, ``theora``, ``mjpeg``,
``wmv3``. Common audio codecs are ``mp2``, ``mp3``, ``dts``, ``aac``,
``wav/pcm``.

Not all codecs can be packed into a given format. For example the mpeg
format is limited to ``mpeg2``, ``mpeg4`` and ``mp3`` codecs (not
entirely true). DVDs do have stringent limitations as well. The opposite
would be ``.avi``: pretty much every audio/video codec combination can
be contained in an avi file-format.

To make things worse, naming conventions for video codecs and formats
are often identical (especially MPEG ones) which leads to confusion. All
in all it is a very wide and deep field. Suffice there are different
uses for different codecs and formats.

Ardour specific issues
----------------------

Ardour supports a wide variety of video file formats codecs. More
specifically, Ardour itself actually does not support any video at all
but delegates handling of video files to
`ffmpeg <http://ffmpeg.org/>`__, which supports over 350 different video
codecs and more than 250 file formats.

When importing a video into Ardour, it will be **transcoded** (changed
from one format and codec to another) to avi/mjpeg for internal use
(this allows reliable seeking to frames at low CPU cost—the file size
will increase, but hard disks are large and fast).

The export dialog includes presets for common format and codec
combinations (such as DVD, web-video,..). If in doubt, one of the
presets should be used.

As a last note: every time a video is transcoded, the quality can only
get worse. Hence for the final mastering/muxing process, one should
always go back and use the original source of the video.
