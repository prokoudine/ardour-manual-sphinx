Creating MIDI regions
=====================

Although :ref:`recording MIDI <midi_recording>` on an existing track is
a common way to create new MIDI regions, it is often desirable to create
new MIDI regions as part of the editing and/or arranging process.

A new MIDI region can be created with the mouse by entering :ref:`Draw
mode <toolbox>` (entered by pressing the d key or clicking on the Draw
tool) and then left-clicking anywhere in an existing MIDI track; this
will create a region that is one bar long. If longer regions are
desired, they can be created by left-clicking anywhere in an existing
MIDI track and dragging the mouse until the region is the desired
length.

Once created, all the typical methods of editing audio regions will work
the same as they do for MIDI regions. See :ref:`Editing Regions and
Selections <editing_regions_and_selections>` for more details.
