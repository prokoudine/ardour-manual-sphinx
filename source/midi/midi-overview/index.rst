MIDI overview
=============

MIDI (or Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a method of
representing musical concepts in a form suitable for use in computers.

MIDI defines 16 different **channels**, along which messages are passed to
instruments or synthesizers that understand the MIDI protocol. Notes are
played by sending appropriately crafted **NoteOn** messages that are
followed by **NoteOff** messages.

MIDI channels can be manipulated with special **controller** messages to
alter the pitch of instruments, or their volume or timbre, and they can
also tell the instrument or synthesizer what sound to play using **Program
Change** and **Bank Select** messages.

.. note::
   Typically, **Program Change** and **Bank Select** messages are collectively
   referred to by the singular term **Patch Change**.

Key features of Ardour MIDI handling
------------------------------------

-  MIDI, just like audio, exists in regions. MIDI regions behave like
   audio regions: they can be moved, trimmed, copied (cloned), or
   deleted. Ardour allows either editing MIDI (or audio) regions, or
   MIDI region content (the notes), but never both at the same time. The
   :kbd:`e` key (by default) sets :ref:`Internal Edit
   <toolbox_edit_internal>` Mode, which allows the editing of MIDI data
   in a given region.
-  All MIDI I/O is handled by the audio/MIDI backend was chosen when
   starting Ardour. In general, all backends provide sample accurate
   timing and maximal efficiency when communicating with external
   software synthesizers.
-  Every MIDI track has its own input port; it may have an arbitrary
   combination of audio and MIDI outputs, depending on the signal
   processing in the track; the full flexibility of Ardour patching &
   connectivity is present for MIDI just as it is for audio.
-  Full automation for MIDI tracks, integrated with the handling of all
   MIDI CC data for each track.
-  Controllers (CC data) can be set to discrete or continuous modes; the
   latter will linearly interpolate between control points and send
   additional data.

Notable differences compared to other DAWs and sequencers
---------------------------------------------------------

-  Fader (volume) control currently operates on transmitted MIDI data,
   not by sending CC #7.
-  All note/data editing is per-region. There are no cross-region
   operations at this time.
-  By default, copying a MIDI region creates a **deep link**â€”both regions
   share the same data source, and edits to the contents of one will
   affect the other. Breaking this link is done by selecting **MIDI >
   Unlink from other copies** from the region context menu, after which
   the selected region(s) will have their own copies of *only* the data
   that they visually display on screen. The region will no longer be
   trimmable back to its original length after an Unlink operation, and
   the operation cannot be undone.
