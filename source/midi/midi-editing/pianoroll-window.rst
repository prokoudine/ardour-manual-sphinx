Pianoroll window
================

Pianoroll windows are a conventional user interface for editing MIDI
data. It's possible to open several regions for editing in dedicated
pianoroll windows at a time:

#. Select a MIDI region on the timeline.
#. Right-click, then select {region name} > Edit in a separate window…

The user interface largely resembles that of in-place editing in the
main window on the timeline.

Playback controls:

-  Play once starting at the beginning of the region
-  Loop-playback the region until stopped
-  Solo toggle for the track where the region is located

Note display controls:

-  Select visible MIDI channel: notes on this channel will be editable,
   notes on other channels will be displayed as ghost notes that cannot
   be edited
-  Note mode selector: whether to display notes in regular or drum
   (diamond-shaped) mode
-  Follow playhead: whether the pianoroll window should automatocally
   scroll horizontally to follow the playhead

Note editing controls:

-  Draw vs Edit mode selection
-  Snapping toggle: enables or disables snapping to selected grid units
-  Grid mode: allows selecting a specific grid unit or no grid at all
-  Length: default note length for notes created by single-clicking on
   the timeline
-  Velocity: default note velocity. The 'Auto' option inherits the
   velocity from the nearest note

Zoom controls:

-  Zoom in
-  Zoom out
-  Zoom to show the entire region
-  Zoom focus mode

Note area
---------

This areas displays all editable notes and provides control for panning
between staves and tweaking the beginning and the end of the region.

.. figure:: images/pianoroll-window-editing-area.png

   :width: 100.0%

The area on the left controls the visible note range. `See
here <@@controlling-midi-range>`__ for the detailed explanation how to
use the widget.

The orange handles on the left and on the right control the start and
the end of the region's visible part. For example, dragging the orange
start marker (on the left) to the right is equivalent to using the Grab
tool to pick the left side of the region and trim the beginning of the
region.

Drawing and editing MIDI notes works the same way as in the main window:

-  Select the Draw mode and then click and drag to add a note.
   Alternatively, press and hold Shift and click and drag to brush notes
   at the interval defined by global quantization.
-  Select the Edit mode, click on a note or rubberband-select multiple
   note, then click and drag notes by their middle to move them, or
   click and drag on the left or the right side of one note to trim or
   extend.

Automation area
---------------

This area displays note velocity and controllers and is disabled by
default. Clicking on any of the available controller options (Velocity,
Bender, Pressure, Modulation) enables it.

   :width: 100.0%

To enable or disable an automation lane, click on the small LED
indicator to the left of its name on the bottoom toolbar.

The area can display data from multiple controllers, overlaid on top of
each other, but only one automation lane is editable at the time.

To select the automation lane to edit, click on the controller name. The
lane data will become editable, and the relevant button will get a red
outline (Velocity on the screenshot above).
