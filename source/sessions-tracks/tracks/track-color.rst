Track color
===========

New tracks in Ardour are assigned a random color from a pastel color palette, so they should never end up being particularly bright or particularly dark.

Changing the color of specific tracks
-------------------------------------

Changing the color of a track is done by selecting the track(s) and right-clicking on the track header of one of them then from the context menu, selecting **Color** and picking a hue in the color dialog. Every selected track will be re-colored.

.. note::
   If only one track is changed, right-clicking on that track's header will be enough to select it, saving the extra mouse click.

Changing the color of all tracks in a group
-------------------------------------------

Tracks that belong to a :ref:`track/bus group <the_track_and_bus_group_list>` can share a common color by enabling the **Color** option for the group. With this enabled, any color change will be propagated to all group members.

The group color can also be explicitly changed by context-clicking on the group tab in the Mixer, selecting **Edit Groupâ€¦**, and then clicking on the color selector in the displayed dialog.
