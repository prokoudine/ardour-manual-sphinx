Renaming sessions
=================

Using the **Session > Rename** menu command allows to give the session a new name. A dialog will appear asking for the new one.

This operation does **not** make a new session folderâ€”the existing session folder and relevant contents are renamed. If the session was not saved before a rename operation, it will be saved automatically and then renaming will continue.

Ardour's **Session > Save As** operation will not make a new copy of the session folder and its contents. All it does is create a new session file.
