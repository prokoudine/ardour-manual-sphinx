Getting more plugins
====================

The following list shows a few plugin packages. In some cases, a package
contains just one or two plugins; in other cases, dozens.

This list does not aim at being exhaustive.

How to install plugins?
-----------------------

Linux
~~~~~

Installation will vary a little depending on how the plugins have been
obtained. If a particular plugin package appears in the local
repository, installing it using is done by using the normal software
package management tool for the system. Most Linux distributions that
are good for audio work will have most of the LADSPA and LV2 plugins
mentioned above available in ready-to-use form.

Finding them will typically require *searching* the distribution's
repository to find the name of the package. The tools for doing this
vary from distribution to distribution. A good place to start searching
is with the name of the package (e.g. "caps" or "cmt"). There are no
fixed rules about what different Linux distributions call their packages
for a given set of plugins.

If the package isn't available, then the plugins can be built from
source (plugins are generally fairly easy to compile and
well-documented).

LADSPA plugins are shared library files. They need to be installed in
either ``/usr/lib/ladspa``, ``/usr/local/lib/ladspa`` or in a directory
mentioned in the local ``LADSPA_PATH`` environment variable.

LV2 plugins are folders/directories. They need to be installed in either
``/usr/lib/lv2``, ``/usr/local/lib/lv2`` or a directory mentioned in the
local ``LV2_PATH`` environment variable.

Linux VST (LXVST) plugins are distributed as shared library files. They
are typically installed in ``/usr/lib/lxvst``, ``/usr/local/lib/lxvst``
or a directory mentioned in the local ``LXVST_PATH`` environment
variable.

macOS
~~~~~

Except for the particularly technical computer user, building and
installing plugins in the LV2 (or LADSPA) format is probably not
something worth planning on.

Most of the plugins likely to be used on macOS will be in Apple's
AudioUnit format. These have their own installation process that tends
to just work.
