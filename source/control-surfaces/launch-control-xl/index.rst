Behavior and configuration
--------------------------

The Launch Control XL was designed for use with Ableton Live, so it has
a Mix mode for controlling the mixer and a Device mode for controlling
various devices. Therefore, For Ardour, only a subset of features is
available out of the box.

The vast majority of supported features are not configurable, the user
interface exposes only one setting: making the 8th fader control the
master bus.
