Connecting the CC121
--------------------

Plug the USB cable from the CC121 into a USB2 or USB3 port on your
computer. The device will be automatically recognized by your operating
system and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in
Ardour.

To connect the CC121 to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, and then
click Control Surfaces. Tick the Enable checkbox opposite to "Steinberg
CC121" to activate Ardour's CC121 support.

Once the device is activated, click Show Protocol Settings and in the
newly opened window select the device in the drop-down lists for
incoming and outgoing MIDI events.

Once you select the input and output port, the CC121 will be ready to
use. You only need do this once: once these ports are connected and your
session has been saved, the connections will be made automatically in
this and other future sessions.
