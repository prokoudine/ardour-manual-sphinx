PreSonus FaderPort
==================

Ardour has full support for the Presonus Faderport controller. This is a
compact control surface featuring a single motorized fader, a single
knob (encoder) and 24 buttons with fixed labels. It is a relatively
low-cost device that functions very well to control a single (selected)
track or bus, along with a variety of other "global" settings and
conditions.

Connecting the Faderport
------------------------

The Faderport comes with a single USB socket on the back. Connect a
suitable USB cable from there to a USB port on your computer. As of the
end of 2015, you should avoid USB3 ports—these cause erratic behaviour
with the device. This issue might get fixed by Presonus in the future.

Ardour uses the Faderport in what Presonus calls "native" mode. You do
not need to do anything to enable this—Ardour will set the device to be
in the correct mode. In native mode, the Faderport sends and receives
ordinary MIDI messages to/from the host, and the host understands the
intended meaning of these messages. We note this detail to avoid
speculation about whether Ardour supports the device via the HUI
protocol—it does not.

The Faderport will be automatically recognized by your operating system,
and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in both
Ardour and other similar software.

To connect the Faderport to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, and
then click on "Control Surfaces". Click on the "Enable" button in the
line that says "Faderport" in order to activate Ardour's Faderport
support. Then double click on the line that says "Faderport". A new
dialog will open, containing (among other things) two dropdown selectors
that will allow you to identify the MIDI ports where your Faderport is
connected.

Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize the
Faderport and it will be ready to use. You only need do this once: once
these ports are connected and your session has been saved, the
connections will be made automatically in this and other future
sessions.

You do not need to use the power supply that comes with the Faderport
but without it, the fader will not be motorized. This makes the overall
experience of using the Faderport much less satisfactory, since the
fader will not move when Ardour tells it to, leading to very out-of-sync
conditions between the physical fader position and the "fader position"
inside the program.

Using the Faderport
-------------------

The Faderport's controls can be divided into three groups:

#. Global controls such as the transport buttons
#. Controls which change the settings for particular track or bus
#. Controls which alter which track or bus is modified by the
   per-track/bus controls.

Because the Faderport has only a single set of per-track controls, by
default those controls operate on the first selected track or bus. If
there is no selected track or bus, the controls will do nothing.

Transport buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The transport buttons all work as you would expect.

Rewind
   When pressed on its own, starts the transport moving backwards.
   Successive presses speed up the "rewind" behaviour.

   If pressed while also holding the **Stop** button, the playhead will
   return to the zero position on the timeline.

   If pressed while also holding the **Shift** button, the playhead will
   move to the session start marker.

Fast Forward
   When pressed on its own, starts the transport moving faster than
   normal. Successive presses speed up the "fast forward" behaviour.

   If pressed while also holding the **Shift** button, the playhead will
   move to the session end marker.

Stop
   Stops the transport. Also used in combination with the **Rewind**
   button to "return to zero".

Play
   Starts the transport. If pressed while the transport is already
   rolling at normal speed, causes the playhead to jump to the start of
   the last "roll" and continue rolling ("Poor man's looping").

Record Enable
   Toggles the global record enable setting.

Other global controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mix, Proj, Trns buttons do not obviously correspond to any
particular functions or operations in Ardour. We have therefore allowed
users to choose from a carefully curated set of possible actions that
seem related to the button labels in some clear way. This can be done
via the Faderport configuration dialog accessed via
``Preferences > Control Surfaces``. Each button has 3 possible actions
associated with it:

-  Plain Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed on its
   own.
-  Shift-Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed in
   conjunction with the Shift button.
-  Long Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed on its own
   and held down for more than 0.5 seconds.

Click on the relevant drop-down selector to pick an action as you
prefer.

The User button also has no obvious mapping to specific Ardour
functionality, so we allow users to choose from *any* possible GUI
action. The menu for selecting the action is somewhat confusing and it
can be hard to find what you're looking for. However, all possible
actions are there, so keep looking!

Mix
   Possible actions include:

   -  Toggle Editor & Mixer visibility
   -  Show/Hide the Editor mixer strip

Proj
   Possible actions include:

   -  Toggle Meterbridge visibility
   -  Toggle Session Summary visibility
   -  Toggle Editor Lists visibility
   -  Zoom to session
   -  Zoom in
   -  Zoom out

Trns
   Possible actions include:

   -  Toggle Locations window visibility
   -  Toggle Metronome
   -  Toggle external sync
   -  Set Playhead at current pointer position

Undo/Redo
   Undo causes the last operation carried out in the editor to be undone.  
   When pressed in conjunction with the Shift button, it causes the most
   recent undone operation to be re-done.

Punch
   When pressed on its own, toggles punch recording. If there is no
   punch range set for the session, this will do nothing.

   When pressed in conjunction with the **Shift** button, this moves the
   playhead to the previous marker.

User
   See above. Any and all GUI-initiated actions can be driven by
   pressing this button on its own, or with a "long" press.

   When pressed in conjunction with the **Shift** button, this will move
   the playhead to the next marker.

Loop
   When pressed on its own, this toggles loop playback. If the Ardour
   preference "Loop-is-mode" is enabled, this does nothing to the
   current transport state. If that preference is disabled, then
   engaging loop playback will also start the transport.

   When pressed in conjunction with the **Shift** button, this will
   create a new (unnamed) marker at the current playhead position.

Per-track controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mute
   This toggles the mute setting of the currently controlled track/bus.
   The button will be lit if the track/bus is muted.

Solo
   This toggles the solo (or listen) setting of the currently controlled
   track/bus. The button will be lit if the track/bus is soloed (or set
   to listen mode).

Rec
   This toggles the record-enabled setting of the currently controlled
   track/bus. The button will be lit if the track is record-enabled.
   This button will do nothing if the Faderport is controlling a bus.

Fader
   The fader controls the gain applied to the currently controlled
   track/bus. If the Faderport is powered, changing the gain in Ardour's
   GUI or via another control surface, or via automation, will result in
   the fader moving under its own control.

Knob/Dial/Encoder
   The knob controls 1 or 2 pan settings for the current controlled
   track/bus. When used alone, turning the knob controls the "azimuth"
   or "direction" (between left and right) for the panner in the
   track/bus (if any). This is all you need when controlling
   tracks/busses with 1 input and 2 outputs.

   If controlling a 2 input/2 output track/bus, Ardour's panner has two
   controls: azimuth (direction) and width. The width must be reduced to
   less than 100% before the azimuth can be changed. Pressing the
   **Shift** button while turning the knob will alter the width setting.

   The knob can also be turned while the "User" button is held, in order
   to modify the input gain for the currently controlled track.

Read
   Enables playback/use of fader automation data by the controlled
   track/bus.

Write
   Puts the fader for the controlled track/bus into automation write
   mode. While the transport is rolling, all fader changes will be
   recorded to the fader automation lane for the relevant track/bus.

Touch
   Puts the fader for the controlled track/bus into automation touch
   mode. While the transport is rolling, touching the fader will
   initiate recording all fader changes until the fader is released.
   When the fader is not being touched, existing automation data will be
   played/used to control the gain level.

Off
   This disables all automation modes for the currently controlled
   track/bus. Existing automation data will be left unmodified by any
   fader changes, and will not be used for controlling gain.


Track selection controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can manually change the track/bus controlled by the Faderport by
changing the selected track in Ardour's editor window. If you select
more than 1 track, the Faderport will control the first selected track
and *only* that track/bus.

Left (arrow)
   This causes the Ardour GUI to select the previous track/bus (using
   the current visual order in the editor window), which will in turn
   cause the Faderport to control that track. If there is no previous
   track/bus, the selected track/bus is left unchanged, and the
   Faderport continues to control it.

Right (arrow)
   This causes the Ardour GUI to select the next track/bus (using the
   current visual order in the editor window), which will in turn cause
   the Faderport to control that track. If there is no next track/bus,
   the selected track/bus is left unchanged, and the Faderport continues
   to control it.

Output
   Pressing the **Output** button causes the Faderport to control the
   fader, pan, mute and solo settings of the Master bus. If your session
   does not contain a Master bus, it does nothing. This is a toggle
   button—pressing it again returns Faderport to controlling whichever
   track/bus was selected before the first press of the Output button.

   If your session uses Ardour's monitor section, you can use
   **Shift**-Output to assign it to the Faderport in the same way that
   Output assigns the Master bus. This is also a toggle setting, so the
   second **Shift**-Output will return the Faderport to controlling
   whichever track/bus was selected before.

   If you press **Shift**-Output after a single press to Output (i.e.
   control the Monitor Section while currently controlling the Master
   bus) or vice versa (i.e. control the Master bus while currently
   controlling the Monitor Section), the press will be ignored. This
   avoids getting into a tricky situation where it is no longer apparent
   what is being controlled and what will happen if you try to change
   it.

Bank
   The "Bank" button is currently not used by Ardour.
