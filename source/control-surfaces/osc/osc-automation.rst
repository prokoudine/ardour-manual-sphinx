Automation
==========

Ardour has automation modes for many of its controls. OSC can control
what automation mode a fader uses. See :ref:`Automation <automation>`.

The form of the automation mode command is:

``/strip/[control]/automation ii ssid mode``

-  /strip may also be /select in which case the only parameter is the
   mode.
-  [control] as of Ardour version 5.9 control can be:

   -  gain
   -  fader

   This list will expand.
-  ssid can be a parameter as shown or inline (automation/[ssid]).
   /select has no ssid.
-  mode can be one of:

   -  ``0`` Manual mode
   -  ``1`` Play mode
   -  ``2`` Write mode
   -  ``3`` Touch mode

   The mode value may be sent as a float allowing a "pot" or "slider"
   with a range of 0 to 3 to be used to control mode.

The next version of Ardour will add ``/strip/[control]/automation_name
is ssid mode_name`` as feedback. A surface may choose to use only the
first character of the string (**M**, **P**, **W** or **T**) instead of
the whole string (this is in git now).

The touch mode needs more input so there is a Touch command as well.
It is almost identical to the automation command:

``/strip/[control]/touch ii ssid touch``

The only difference is the last parameter is ``1`` for touched and
``0`` for touch released. All of the rest of the explanation above
applies.
