Regions
=======

The Regions list shows all the regions in the session, with infos about them in a tabular form. Any column caption can be clicked to sort the list according to the clicked value:

Name
   The name of the region, can be modified by double-clicking it

# Ch
   Number of channels for an audio region (0 for MIDI)

Tags
   User-added tag text, can be modified by double clicking it
Start
   Position of the start of the region on the global timeline

Length
   Duration of the region

The time format used for *Start* and *Length* follows the :ref:`Primary Clock <editing_clocks>` one.

At the right of the list are three columns of flags that can be altered:

□ L
   whether the region position is locked, so that it cannot be moved.

□ M
   whether the region is muted, so that it will not be heard.

□ O
   whether the region is opaque; opaque regions ‘block’ regions below them from being heard, whereas ‘transparent’ regions have their contents mixed with whatever is underneath.

Hovering the mouse pointer over a column heading shows a tool-tip which can be handy to remember what the columns are for.

A handy feature of the region list is that its regions can be dragged and dropped into a suitable track in the session.
