Show Strips list
================

The **Show Strips** list is a quick way to manage big sessions, with lots of tracks, where the mixer would otherwise be too crowded.

It is a list of all the tracks, busses and VCA in the session, with a tick to allow for hiding or showing them. This visibility status also affects the Editor view, and is exactly the same as toggling the **V** checkbox in the :ref:`Tracks and Busses <the_tracks_and_busses_list>` panel of the Editor List.

Dragging and dropping tracks inside the Show Strips list allows to reorganise the tracks in the session, both in the Mixer and the Editor. Clicking a track scrolls the Mixer to show this track.

It is possible, by right clicking, to act on multiple tracks at once:

-  Show All
-  Hide All
-  Show All Audio Tracks
-  Hide All Audio Tracks
-  Show All Audio Busses
-  Hide All Audio Busses
-  Show All MIDI Tracks
-  Hide All MIDI Tracks

The :kbd:`+` button under the list is a shortcut to create a new track, bus or VCA, as in clicking **Track > Add Track, Bus or VCAâ€¦**.
