The Region menu
===============

The Region menu is where the user can tweak its regions, the parts of audio or MIDI that sit on the timeline.


Insert Region from Source List
   If a region is selected in the Editor List, add it at the edit point

Play Selected Regions
   Starts playback at the beginning of the selected region(s), and stops at its(their) end

Tag Selected Regions
   Prompts for a text to tag all the selected regions, this tag is visible in the `Region list <@@the-region-list>`__

Loop
   Creates a loop range on the selected region's boundaries, and starts the looped playback

Rename…
   Changes the name of the region, that appears in its top left area

Properties…
   Shows the Region properties window, that displays detailed information about the region and allow for some modifications

Loudness Analysis…
   Shows the Audio Report/Analysis window, that displays detailed `dBFS information <@@metering-in-ardour>`__ as well as a spectrogram (dBFS of frequency against time)

Spectral Analysis…
   Shows the Audio Report/Analysis window, that displays a integrated spectral view of the region (dBFS against frequency)

**Edit**

Combine
   Creates a new region by joining the selected audio regions in the same track, and replaces those region with the newly created compound. The same rules are applied to create the compound as for playback regarding e.g. layering

Uncombine
   Splits back the compound created by *combining* into its original audio regions

Pitch Shift…
   Changes the tune of the audio region, by octave, semitones or percentage, based on spectral analysis. Optionally, and if they have been set for the region, preserves the formants

Split at Percussion Onset
   Allows splitting the selected regions on its Percussion Onsets marker as set by the Rhythm Ferret (Not usable as of 5.5)

Make Mono Regions
   Creates mono regions out of a stereo or multichannel region by splitting it into its discrete channels. The created regions are added to the Editor List

Close Gaps
   Extends (or reduces) the selected regions to be perfectly aligned. Optionally, sets up a crossfade duration, or a pull-back (spacing between regions)

Place Transient
   Places a transient at the edit point. Used e.g. for the **Pitch Shift…** action

Rhythm Ferret…
   Opens the **Rhythm Ferret** which is a powerful tool to sequence audio files

Strip Silence…
   Opens the **Strip Silence** window which is a very handy tool to remove all audio under a user-chosen threshold (with a preview)

Reverse
   Mirrors the audio horizontally

**Layering**

Raise to Top
   On overlapping regions, puts the selected one(s) on top

Raise
   On overlapping region, makes the selected one(s) one layer higher

Lower
   Makes the selected region(s) one layer lower

Lower to Bottom
   Sends the selected region to the background

**MIDI**

Transpose…
   On a MIDI region, shows the :ref:`Transpose MIDI window <transposing_midi>`, allowing to shift the pitch of the whole MIDI region by ± *n* semitones or octaves

Insert Patch Change…
   Inserts a patch change at the Edit Point, allowing a change of patch, channel, program and/or bank

Quantize…
   Shows the :ref:`Quantize window <quantize_midi>`, allowing to perfectly align the MIDI notes to the musical grid

Legatize
   Shortens or elongates the MIDI notes to make them perfectly sequential, i.e. the end of a note is the start of the following one

Remove Overlap
   Shortens or elongates the MIDI notes to make them perfectly sequential, i.e. the end of a note is the start of the following one

Transform…
   :ref:`Transform window <transforming_midi_mathematical_operations>`, that allows for mathematical operations on the midi notes

Unlink all selected regions
   Makes the selected MIDI regions independent, e.g. editing this region won't affect any other one.

Unlink from unselected
   Makes the selected MIDI regions independent from regions outside the selection, but keep the link between the selected ones.

Deinterlace Into Layers
   Splits the selected region(s) to create in-place copies each containing only one channel. A region containing e.g. 3 channels will generate 3 stacked regions containing 1 channel each.

List Editor…
   Shows the :ref:`List Editor <midi_list_editor>` which sequentially lists all the MIDI events in the region, and allows for precise modifications

**Gain**

☐ Opaque
   When checked, makes the region opaque audio-wise, i.e., the underlying regions won't be audible

☐ Mute
   When checked, mutes *only* the selected region on the track, without muting the track. The muted regions will have *!!* prepended to their name and will be semi-transparent

Normalize…
   Shows the **Normalize Region** dialog, which allows to scale the region level by setting its maximum level, optionally constraining the RMS

Boost Gain
   Increases the gain on the selected region by boosting the audio, without touching the envelope or automation

Cut Gain
   Reduces the gain without touching the envelope or automation

Reset Gain
   If the gain has been edited, revert to its initial value

Reset Envelope
   If the gain envelope has been edited, resets it to its initial value (constant at 0 dB)

☐ Invert Polarity
   When checked, inverts the signal's phase in the selected regions and renders the symbol (a diagonal line across zero) next to the names of affected regions

☐ Envelope Active
   When unchecked, disables any envelope editing that has been made. The envelope will be displayed in yellow instead of green.

**Position**

Move to Original Position
   Moves the region where it was initially recorded or inserted in the session

Snap Position to Grid
   If the Grid Mode is set to *Grid*, snaps the region to the nearest grid line

☐ Lock
   Locks the selected regions at their current positions in time and tracks, avoiding any movement on the timeline. The region name will be surrounded by *>* and *<* brackets

☐ Lock to Video
   Same as above, relative to the position in the video

Set Sync Position
   Creates or move the sync position, i.e. the point of the region that will be aligned or snapped to the grid, and that is (by default) the beginning of the region.

Remove Sync
   Removes any user defined sync point, and resets the sync position to the beginning of the region

Nudge Later
   Moves the region to the right by the amount shown in the :ref:`nudge timer <nudge_controls>`

Nudge Earlier
   Same as above, to the left

Nudge Later by Capture Offset
   Moves the region to the right by the capture latency computed by Ardour based on the user's settings regarding latency

Nudge Earlier by Capture Offset
   Same as above, to the left

Sequence Regions
   Puts the selected regions one after the other, so that the end of one region is the beginning of the next one, removing any overlap or silence. The reference point is the earliest region.

**Markers**

Add Region Cue Marker
   Opens a dialog to enter a region-level marker at the mouse pointer position

Clear Region Cue Markers
   Removes all markers from the selected regions

Convert Region Cue Markers to CD Markers
   Converts all markers from selected regions to CD markers, bit doesn't delete original region-level markers

Convert Region Cue Markers to Location Markers
   Converts all markers from selected regions to location markers, bit doesn't delete original region-level markers

**Trim**

Trim Start at Edit Point
   If the edit point is within the region boundaries, shortens the region to align its start with the Edit Point

Trim End at Edit Point
   Same as above, for the end of the region

Trim to Loop
   Uses both the start and end loop markers to shorten the region

Trim to Punch
   Same as above with the punch markers

Trim to Previous
   On overlapping regions, shortens the selected one so that the previous region is complete, i.e. the new start point for the selected region is the end point of the previous region on the timeline

Trim to Next
   Same as above, with the end of the selected region aligned to the start of the following one.

**Ranges**

Set Loop Range
   Creates a loop range based on the selected regions, i.e. the start of the loop range is the start of the earliest region, and the end of the loop is the end of the latest region.

Set Punch
   Same as above, for the punch range

Add Single Range Marker
   Same as above, for the edit range

Add Range Marker Per Region
   For each selected region, creates its own edit range based on the boundaries of each region

Set Range Selection
   Creates a range selection based on the boundaries of the selected regions

**Fades**

☐ Fade In
   Activates/deactivates the fade in at the start of the region

☐ Fade Out
   Same as above, for the fade out at the end of the region

☐ Fades
   Shortcut to activate/deactivate both the fade in and fade out

**Duplicate**

Duplicate
   Creates a copy of the selected region(s) and appends it to the original

Multi-Duplicate…
   Shows the **Duplicate** dialog, allowing to create multiple copies, or a not-integer number of copies (the last one will then be truncated)

Fill Track
   Creates duplicates until it fills the session, i.e. reaches the End marker of the session. The last duplicate may be truncated to fit in

Export…
   Shows the :ref:`Export dialog <export_dialog>`, with all parameters set to export only the selected region(s)

Bounce (without processing)
   Creates a bounce, i.e. a version of the region with all the edits (boundaries, envelope), as a new region in the Editor List, without any of the effects of the mixer strip

Bounce (with processing)
   Same as above, *with* the effects of the mixer strip

Remove
   Deletes the region from the edit (no file is harmed in the process, and the region stays in the Editor for later use)
