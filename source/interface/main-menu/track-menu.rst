The Track menu
==============

The Track menu is where one can deal with the tracks, busses and control masters.

Add Track, Bus or VCA…
   Shows the `Add Track, Bus or VCA… window <@@adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas>`__, where one can add one or more tracks, busses or control masters to the session and define its parameters

Duplicate Tracks/Busses…
   Shows the Duplicate Tracks and Busses window, allowing to duplicate the selected track(s) and optionally, its playlist

Toggle Record Enable
   Sets the Record Enable mode On on the selected track(s). These tracks will record audio/midi next time the global record is active and playback is started.

Toggle Solo
   Sets the solo On on the selected tracks, so only these tracks will play

Toggle Mute
   Mutes the selected tracks, they won't play until unmuted

**Playlists**

Insert Time
   Shows the `Insert Time window <@@insert-remove-time>`__, allowing to insert a blank time in the selected tracks' playlist

Remove Time
   Same as `above <@@insert-remove-time>`__, but to remove time

Remove Gaps
   Locates gaps between regions and minimizes them, both original and final gap lengths are user-defined

Move Selected Tracks Up
   Changes the position of the selected tracks one track up towards the top. In the mixer, the tracks will be moved to the left.

Move Selected Tracks Down
   Same as above, towards the bottom

**Height**

Fit Selection (Vertical)
   Will fit the selected track(s) in the window. If too many tracks are selected, they'll be reduced to their minimum height.

Largest
   Sets the selected tracks height to a very high value, hence making the tracks wide on screen

Larger
   Same as above, but a little less high

Large
   Same as above, but again less high

Normal
   Sets the height of the track to its default value which is a trade-off between readability and number of tracks displayed

Small
   Reduces the size of the tracks to a low value, increasing the number of on screen tracks

Toggle Active
   Toggles the active state of a track. An inactive track will be grayed and won't play any sound. That can be seen in the A column of the `Tracks and Busses List <@@the-tracks-and-busses-list>`__

Remove
   Deletes this track and its playlist (no file is harmed in the process, and the regions from the playlist stay in the Editor for later use)
