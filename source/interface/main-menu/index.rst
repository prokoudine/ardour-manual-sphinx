Main Menu
=========

The Main Menu allows the user to interact with Ardour and may appear
daunting at first. Below is a reference of all the menus and submenus.

Most of these menus, and probably all of the most used ones, have
keyboard shortcuts to make using them easier and faster. A summary of
these shortcuts can be found on the `Defaults Keyboard
Bindings <@@default-shortcuts>`__ page, and every menu in Ardour can be
reassigned to an user defined key binding, or used via
`OSC <@@controlling-ardour-with-osc>`__ with a control surface.

Some menu items placement may depend on the OS, e.g. the "About" window
may not be in the Help menu on Mac systems.
