Main menu
=========

The main menu allows the user to interact with Ardour and may appear
daunting at first. Below is a reference of all the menus and submenus.

Most of these menus, and probably all of the most used ones, have
keyboard shortcuts to make using them easier and faster. A summary of
these shortcuts can be found on the :ref:`Default keyboard 
bindings <default_keyboard_bindings>` page, and every menu in Ardour can be
reassigned to an user defined key binding, or used via
:ref:`OSC <open_sound_control>` with a control surface.

Some menu items placement may depend on the OS, e.g. the **About** window
may not be in the **Help** menu on Mac systems.
