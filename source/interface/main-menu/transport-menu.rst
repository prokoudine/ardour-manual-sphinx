The Transport menu
==================

The Transport menu handles how Ardour handles the playback and playhead.

Start/Stop
   Starts or stops the playhead, and recording if it is armed

**Play**

Play Selection
   Only plays the selected duration of the session, based on the current range or selected region(s)

Solo Selection
   Only plays the selected regions of the session. Regions that are not selected, even on a track with selected regions, wont be played

Play w/Preroll
   As the previous menu, except it starts the playback a few bars or seconds before the beginning of the selection (the amount of time can be set in the `Preferences <@@preferences#preferences-transport>`__)

Start/Continue/Stop
   Leaves loop play or range play mode but without stopping the transport

Play from Edit Point and Return
   Starts the playback at the `Edit point <@@edit-point-control>`__, and when stopped, goes back to the original location

   This is a shortcut to trigger the global recording, and start playback at once

   As the Start Recording menu, except it waits for 2 bars before the playhead's position. The Metronome will tick (even if disabled) during the count-in
