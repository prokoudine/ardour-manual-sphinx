Why is it called Ardour?
========================

The name **Ardour** came from considerations of how to pronounce the
acronym HDR. The most obvious attempt sounds like a vowel-less "harder"
and it was then a short step to an unrelated but slightly homophonic
word:

   | **ardour** *n* 1: a feeling of strong eagerness (usually in favor of a
     person or cause); "they were imbued with a revolutionary ardor";
     "he felt a kind of religious zeal" [syn: ardor, elan, zeal]
   | 2: intense feeling of love [syn: ardor]
   | 3: feelings of great warmth and intensity; "he spoke with great
     ardor" [syn: ardor, fervor, fervour, fervency, fire, fervidness]

Given the work required to develop Ardour, and the personality of its
primary author, the name seemed appropriate even without the vague
relationship to HDR.

Years later, another interpretation of "Ardour" appeared, this time
based on listening to non-native English speakers attempt to pronounce
the word. Rather than "Ardour", it became "Our DAW", which seemed
poetically fitting for a Digital Audio Workstation whose source code and
design belongs to a group of collaborators.
