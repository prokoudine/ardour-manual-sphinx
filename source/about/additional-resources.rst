Additional resources
====================

In addition to this documentation, there are a variety of other **resources**:

-  the `Ardour release notes <https://ardour.org/whatsnew.html>`__
-  the `Ardour Forums <https://discourse.ardour.org/>`__
-  information about `Ardour    Support <https://community.ardour.org/community>`__ via mailing lists    and IRC (chat)

The **IRC channels** in particular are where most of the day-to-day development and debugging is done, and there are plenty of experienced users to help if problems are encountered when using Ardour.

Please be prepared to hang around for a few hours, the chat is usually busiest from 19:00 UTC to 04:00 UTC. It is best to keep one's IRC client window open if possible, so that a belated answer can be seen.
