.. _region_context_menu:

Region context menu
===================

In the editor window, right clicking (context clicking) on a region
displays a menu with **track and region operations**. The menu begins
with the name of the region, or **Selected Regions** if multiple regions
are selected. Selecting it will display :ref:`the Region menu
<the_region_menu>` for operations on this(these) region(s).

.. note::
   Some items may not be in the exact same order as in the main menu.

If there is more than one region layered at the point clicked, the menu
will also contain a **Choose Top** item. This dialog allows to select
which region should be on the top **layer**. See :ref:`Adjusting Region
Layering <layering_display>` for more details.

Below these items is the rest of the :ref:`Track Context Menu
<track_context_menu>`, which provides access to track-level operations.
