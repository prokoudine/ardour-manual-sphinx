Copy regions
============

Copy a single region
--------------------

Copying a region is done using the :ref:`Grab mouse mode <toolbox>`, by
moving the mouse pointer into the region and :kbd:`Ctrl`-left-dragging.
Ardour creates a new region and follows the mouse pointer as it moves.
See :ref:`Move Regions <move-regions-with-the-mouse>` for more details
on moving the copied region.

Copy multiple regions
---------------------

Copying multiple regions requires them to be selected before copying.
Then :kbd:`Ctrl`-left-dragging one of the selected regions will copy the
regions as they move. The copied regions will keep their positions
relative to each other.

Fixed-time copying
------------------

Copying region(s) to other track(s) while keeping the copies at the same
exact position on the timeline as the originals is done by simply using
a :kbd:`Ctrl`-middle-drag instead.
