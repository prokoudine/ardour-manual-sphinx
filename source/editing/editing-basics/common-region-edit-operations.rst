Common region edit operations
=============================

This section covers a set of **region editing operations** that are
likely to be used often while working on a session. Depending on work
habits (and experience of other DAWs), some of these operations will be
critical while others are used only rarely.

All of these operations can be carried out from the keyboard (see
:ref:`Default Keyboard Shortcuts <default_shortcuts>` for a list).
Equivalent operations can be performed with the mouse in most cases.

Some of these operations make use of :ref:`the edit point/range
<edit_point_control>` and :ref:`affect specific regions
<which_regions_are_affected>`.
