Controlling playback
====================

   :alt: The playhead
   :class: right-float

The playhead is a red vertical line that indicates the current position of playback.

Positioning the Playhead
------------------------

Positioning the playhead at the current pointer position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pressing :kbd:`P` will set the playhead to the current position of the mouse pointer, if it is within the editor track area.

Positioning the playhead on the timeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A left click anywhere on the :ref:`Ruler <ruler>` will move the playhead to that position.

Positioning the playhead with the transport clocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking on either the primary or secondary transport clock and :ref:`editing their value <editing_clocks>` moves the playhead to a specific position.

Positioning the playhead at a marker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right-clicking on the marker and selecting either **Locate to Here** or **Play from Here** will place the playhead at the marker's position.

Alternatively, placing the mouse pointer on the marker and pressing :kbd:`P` sets the playhead precisely on the marker location.

Looping the Transport
---------------------

When the :ref:`loop transport <the_loop_range>` button is pressed, the playhead will jump the start of the loop range, and continue to the end of that range before returning to the start and repeating.

While looping, a light green area is displayed in the ruler over the tracks to show the loop range.

By default, looping is bound to the :kbd:`l` key.
