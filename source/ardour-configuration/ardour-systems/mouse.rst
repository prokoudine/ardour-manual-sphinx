The right mouse
===============

Ardour is designed to work best with a **three-button mouse** equipped with a **scroll wheel**. While it can be used with a two button mouse or touchpad, at least two key operations will not be (easily) available:

-  time-constrained region copying
-  `MIDI bindings <@@generic-midi-learn>`__ created by "learning" them from incoming MIDI data

It is strongly encouraged to invest in a three-button mouse. A good quality mouse (especially one with a weighted, latchable scroll wheel) will make the use of Ardour vastly more efficient. They are cheap, and time is not.

For information on how to use the mouse in Ardour, see `Using the mouse <@@using-the-mouse>`__.
