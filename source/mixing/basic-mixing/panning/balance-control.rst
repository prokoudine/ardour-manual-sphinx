Balance control
===============

For stereo tracks, it is possible to switch between the default stereo
panner and a traditional balance control by right-clicking on the panner
widget.

   Stereo balance control

When the balance is centered, the incoming signals will be unaffected.
Moving it to one side will linearly attenuate the signal of the opposite
side.

.. note::
   While the balance control is considerably less flexible than the
   stereo panner, it works with arbitrary content without danger of
   introducing comb filter artefacts.
